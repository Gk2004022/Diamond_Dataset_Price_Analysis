# 💎 Diamond Price Analysis & Visualization

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a large diamond dataset containing ~54,000 records with various characteristics such as **carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and price**.  
Using Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Data Visualization, this project uncovers patterns affecting diamond pricing and quality evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project: **`diamond.csv`**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| carat | Weight of the diamond |
| cut | Cut quality (Fair ➜ Ideal) |
| color | Diamond color grade (D ➜ J) |
| clarity | Purity level (IF ➜ I3) |
| depth | Total depth percentage |
| table | Width of the top of diamond compared to widest point |
| price | Price in USD |
| x, y, z | Dimensions in millimeters |

✅ Dataset was cleaned by handling missing values & outliers  
✅ Converted data types where necessary for accurate analysis

## 🔍 Key Analysis & Insights

This project provides answers to the following:

- 📌 How does **carat** affect **price**?
- 📌 Which **cut** has the highest average price?
- 📌 Price comparison across **color** and **clarity**
- 📌 Correlation between physical dimensions and pricing
- 📌 Distribution of diamonds across categories

✔ Multiple visualizations (Histograms, Pairplots, Heatmaps, Boxplots, etc.)  
✔ Interpretation of each graph for improved understanding
